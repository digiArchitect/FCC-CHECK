# FCC-CHECK
What your application does:
FCC-CHECK is a python application which uses the genius API to detect whether or not a song will be acceptable on the air waves.
We used python for this project as it is the programming language that we are the most familiar with. As of now the application only returns whether or not a song is acceptable on the airwaves, the acceptable lyrics, and the non allowed words. However, there are plans to implement a gui for ease-of-access as well as to optimize the code for faster returns using list comprehension and better applications of algorithmic data.
